Summary:
    Places the core into sleep and sets up the USB module

PreCondition:
    
Parameters:

Remarks:
    Please note that before calling this function that it is the
    responsibility of the application to place all of the other
    peripherals or board features into a lower power state if
    required.

    Based on the USB specifications, upon detection of the suspend condition, a
    USB device should promptly put itself into a low power mode (such that it consumes
    no more than 2.5mA from the USB host (unless the host is a USB type-C host and
    is actively advertising higher than standard USB spec current capability).

Function:
    bool USBRemoteWakeupAssertBlocking(void)

Summary:
    Checks if it is currently legal to send remote wakeup signaling to the
    host, and if so, it sends it.  This is a blocking function that takes ~5-6ms
    to execute.

PreCondition:

Parameters:
    None

Return Values:
    true  - if it was legal to send remote wakeup signaling and the signaling was sent
    false - if it was not legal to send remote wakeup signaling (in this case, no signaling gets sent)

Remarks:
    To successfully use remote wakeup in an application, the device must first
    let the host know that it supports remote wakeup (by setting the appropriate
    bit in the attributes field of the USB configuration descriptor).  Additionally,
    the end user must allow/enable remote wakeup for the device.  Hosts are not
    obligated to always allow remote wakeup, and the end user can typically enable/disable this
    feature for each device at their discretion.  Under Windows, devices supporting
    remote wakeup will normally have an extra checkbox setting under the device
    manager properties pages for the device, which the user can change.

    Additionally, remote wakeup capability requires driver support, in the USB
    class drivers being used for the device on the host.  Under Windows 7, the CDC
    drivers do not support remote wakeup capability, while other drivers like HID
    and WinUSB fully support this capability.  If the intended application is
    CDC or based on some other driver not supporting remote wakeup, it is potentially
    possible to make the device a composite device (ex: CDC+HID) and then use the
    HID driver as a means of achieving the remote wakeup effect of the host.

    Sometime prior to entering USB suspend (usually just prior), if the host and
    driver(s) support remote wakeup, and the user has enabled the feature for the
    device, then the host will send notification to the device firmware letting it
    know that remote wakeup is legal.  The USBGetRemoteWakeupStatus() API function
    can be used to check if the host has allowed remote wakeup or not.  The application
    firmware should not send remote wakeup signaling to the host, unless both
    USBGetRemoteWakeupStatus() and USBIsBusSuspended() return true.  Attempting to
    send the remote wakeup signaling to the host when it is not legal to do so
    will normally not wake up the host, and will instead create a violation of
    the USB compliance criteria.  Additionally, devices should not send remote
    wakeup signaling immediately upon entry into the suspended bus state.  Based on
    the USB specifications, the bus must be continuously idle for at least 5ms before
    a device may send remote wakeup signaling.  After the signaling is sent, the
    device must become fully ready for normal USB communication/request
    processing within 10ms.

/********************************************************************
Function:
    int8_t USBVBUSSessionValidStateGet(bool AllowInvasiveReads)

Summary:
    This function tries to check the current VBUS voltage level to see if it is
    above the session valid threshold or not.  This is useful for detecting if the
    device is currently attached to a host or hub that is actively supplying
    power on the +5V VBUS net (instead of being powered down).

PreCondition:
    This function assumes that USBDeviceInit() has been called at least once,
    although it is not necessary for the USB module to be already enabled, if
    "invasive reads" are allowed.  However, it is always the caller's responsibility
    to make sure that the microcontroller system clock settings have been
    pre-configured for an operating mode that are compatible with USB operation
    at the right frequency (ex: the USB module must have 48MHz clocking available
    internally), prior to calling this function.

Parameters:
    bool AllowInvasiveReads - Specify false if you want this function to perform
    a "passive" read attempt, which will not block or change the state of the USB module.
    If this parameter is false, the function can return a negative number, indicating
    that the read could not be performed (ex: if the comparators are currently off).

    Specify true, if you want this function to perform a forceful read operation.
    In this case, this function will turn on the USB module and/or unsuspend it if
    needed, in order to read the actual value.  The function will always return 0 or 1
    in this case.  However, the function may block for as much time as required to
    ensure that any necessary analog startup/settling/propagation times have
    elapsed, so as to get an accurate reading.  If invasive reads are allowed, and
    this function turns on the USB module or unsuspends it, the module will remain
    on and unsuspended subsequent to returning from this function.
    It is the caller's responsibility to turn the USB module off if
    desired/appropriate for the application (ex: because the returned value was
    0, indicating VBUS is not currently powered, in which case the application may
    wish to shut things down for lower power consumption).


Return Values:
    Returns a signed 8-bit byte indicating the current VBUS level.  If VBUS is above
    the session valid state (ex: because the cable is attached and a host or hub is actively
    sourcing VBUS power), the return value will be 1.  If the VBUS level is below
    the session valid level (ex: because the cable is detached or the host/hub is
    powered down and not sourcing anything on VBUS), the return value will be 0.
    If the function could not conclusively determine the state of the VBUS line
    (ex: because the VBUS sensing comparator wasn't powered on for example), the
    return value will be a negative number (ex: return value of -1 or less, with
    the actual value indicating a code representing the reason why the value
    couldn't be read).

Remarks:
    This function may block for upwards of ~5ms if AllowInvasiveReads was true
    and the USB module wasn't previously turned or or was recently (or is still) suspended.

/********************************************************************
Function:
    static void USBRestorePreviousInterruptSettings(void)

Summary:
    This is a private function that should never be called directly by
    user application code.  This function restores the state of all IECx interrupt
    enable register bits that were previously modified by the
    USBSaveAndPrepareInterruptsForSleep() function.

PreCondition:
    Must only be called by USB stack code in the context of a USB suspend or
    USB detach event handler, after the event has ended and it is time to
    restore the previous operating status.

Parameters:
    None

Return Values:
    None

Remarks:
    Application code should not call or modify this function.  This function
    must always be called in an exact 1:1 ratio with the
    USBSaveAndPrepareInterruptsForSleep() function.
