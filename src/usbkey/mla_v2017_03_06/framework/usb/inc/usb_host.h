  Function:
    bool (*USB_CLIENT_EVENT_HANDLER) ( uint8_t address, USB_EVENT event,
                        void *data, uint32_t size )

  Summary:
    This is a typedef to use when defining a client driver event handler.

  Description:
    This data type defines a pointer to a call-back function that must be
    implemented by a client driver if it needs to be aware of events on the
    USB.  When an event occurs, the Host layer will call the client driver
    via this pointer to handle the event.  Events are identified by the
    "event" parameter and may have associated data.  If the client driver was
    able to handle the event, it should return true.  If not (or if
    additional processing is required), it should return false.

  Precondition:
    The client must have been initialized.

  Parameters:
    uint8_t address    - Address of device where event occurred
    USB_EVENT event - Identifies the event that occured
    void *data      - Pointer to event-specific data
    uint32_t size      - Size of the event-specific data

  Return Values:
    true    - The event was handled
    false   - The event was not handled

  Remarks:
    The application may also implement an event handling routine if it
    requires knowledge of events.  To do so, it must implement a routine that
    matches this function signature and define the USB_HOST_APP_EVENT_HANDLER
    macro as the name of that function.

  Summary:
    This is a typedef to use when defining a client driver initialization
    handler.

  Description:
    This routine is a call out from the host layer to a USB client driver.
    It is called when the system has been configured as a USB host and a new
    device has been attached to the bus.  Its purpose is to initialize and
    activate the client driver.

  Precondition:
    The device has been configured.

  Parameters:
    uint8_t address        - Device's address on the bus
    uint32_t flags         - Initialization flags
    uint8_t clientDriverID - ID to send when issuing a Device Request via
                            USBHostIssueDeviceRequest() or USBHostSetDeviceConfiguration().
                            
  Return Values:
    true    - Successful
    false   - Not successful

  Remarks:
    There may be multiple client drivers.  If so, the USB host layer will
    call the initialize routine for each of the clients that are in the
    selected configuration.

  Function:

            void *data, uint32_t size )

  Summary:
    This is a typedef to use when defining the application level events
    handler.

  Description:
    This function is implemented by the application.  The function name can
    be anything - the macro USB_HOST_APP_EVENT_HANDLER must be set in
    usb_config.h to the name of the application function.

    In the application layer, this function is responsible for handling all
    application-level events that are generated by the stack.  See the
    enumeration USB_EVENT for a complete list of all events that can occur.
    Note that some of these events are intended for client drivers
    (e.g. EVENT_TRANSFER), while some are intended for for the application
    layer (e.g. EVENT_UNSUPPORTED_DEVICE).

    If the application can handle the event successfully, the function
    should return true.  For example, if the function receives the event
    EVENT_VBUS_REQUEST_POWER and the system can allocate that much power to
    an attached device, the function should return true.  If, however, the
    system cannot allocate that much power to an attached device, the
    function should return false.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t address        - Address of the USB device generating the event
    USB_EVENT event     - Event that occurred
    void *data          - Optional pointer to data for the event
    uint32_t size          - Size of the data pointed to by *data

  Return Values:
    true    - Event was processed successfully
    false   - Event was not processed successfully

  Remarks:
    If this function is not provided by the application, then all application
    events are assumed to function without error.

  Summary:
    This function indicates if the specified device has explicit client
    driver support specified in the TPL.

  Description:
    This function indicates if the specified device has explicit client
    driver support specified in the TPL.  It is used in client drivers'
    USB_CLIENT_INIT routines to indicate that the client driver should be
    used even though the class, subclass, and protocol values may not match
    those normally required by the class.  For example, some printing devices
    do not fulfill all of the requirements of the printer class, so their
    class, subclass, and protocol fields indicate a custom driver rather than
    the printer class.  But the printer class driver can still be used, with
    minor limitations.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t deviceAddress  - Address of device

  Return Values:
    true    - This device is listed in the TPL by VID andPID, and has explicit
                client driver support.
    false   - This device is not listed in the TPL by VID and PID.

  Remarks:
    This function is used so client drivers can allow certain
    devices to enumerate.  For example, some printer devices indicate a custom
    class rather than the printer class, even though the device has only minor
    limitations from the full printer class.   The printer client driver will
    fail to initialize the device if it does not indicate printer class support
    in its interface descriptor.  The printer client driver could allow any
    device with an interface that matches the printer class endpoint
    configuration, but both printer and mass storage devices utilize one bulk

  Summary:
    This function sends a standard device request to the attached device.

  Description:
    This function sends a standard device request to the attached device.
    The user must pass in the parameters of the device request.  If there is
    input or output data associated with the request, a pointer to the data
    must be provided.  The direction of the associated data (input or output)
    must also be indicated.

    This function does no special processing in regards to the request except
    for three requests.  If SET INTERFACE is sent, then DTS is reset for all
    endpoints.  If CLEAR FEATURE (ENDPOINT HALT) is sent, then DTS is reset
    for that endpoint.  If SET CONFIGURATION is sent, the request is aborted
    with a failure.  The function USBHostSetDeviceConfiguration() must be
    called to change the device configuration, since endpoint definitions may
    change.

  Precondition:
    The host state machine should be in the running state, and no reads or
    writes to EP0 should be in progress.

  Parameters:
    uint8_t deviceAddress  - Device address
    uint8_t bmRequestType  - The request type as defined by the USB
                            specification.
    uint8_t bRequest       - The request as defined by the USB specification.
    uint16_t wValue         - The value for the request as defined by the USB
                            specification.
    uint16_t wIndex         - The index for the request as defined by the USB
                            specification.
    uint16_t wLength        - The data length for the request as defined by the
                            USB specification.
    uint8_t *data          - Pointer to the data for the request.
    uint8_t dataDirection  - USB_DEVICE_REQUEST_SET or USB_DEVICE_REQUEST_GET
    uint8_t clientDriverID - Client driver to send the event to.

  Return Values:
    USB_SUCCESS                 - Request processing started
    USB_UNKNOWN_DEVICE          - Device not found
    USB_INVALID_STATE           - The host must be in a normal running state

  Description:
    This function initiates a read from the attached device.

    If the endpoint is isochronous, special conditions apply.  The pData and

    no upper layer intervention until USBHostTerminateTransfer() is called.
    The ISOCHRONOUS_DATA_BUFFERS structure should not be manipulated until

    USBHostReadIsochronous() when reading from an isochronous endpoint.

  Parameters:
    uint8_t deviceAddress  - Device address
    uint8_t endpoint       - Endpoint number

                            ISOCHRONOUS_DATA_BUFFERS structure, with multiple
                            data buffer pointers.
    uint32_t size          - Number of data bytes to read. If the endpoint is
                            isochronous, this is the number of data buffer
                            pointers pointed to by pData.

  Return Values:
    USB_SUCCESS                     - Read started successfully.

  Summary:
    This function executes the host tasks for USB host operation.

  Description:
    This function executes the host tasks for USB host operation.  It must be
    executed on a regular basis to keep everything functioning.

    The primary purpose of this function is to handle device attach/detach
    and enumeration.  It does not handle USB packet transmission or
    reception; that must be done in the USB interrupt handler to ensure
    timely operation.

    This routine should be called on a regular basis, but there is no
    specific time requirement.  Devices will still be able to attach,
    enumerate, and detach, but the operations will occur more slowly as the
    calling interval increases.

  Precondition:
    USBHostInit() has been called.

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None

  Summary:
    This function initiates whether or not the last endpoint transaction is

  Description:
    This function initiates whether or not the last endpoint transaction is
    complete.  If it is complete, an error code and the number of bytes
    transferred are returned.

    For isochronous transfers, byteCount is not valid.  Instead, use the
    returned byte counts for each EVENT_TRANSFER event that was generated
    during the transfer.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t deviceAddress  - Device address
    uint8_t endpoint       - Endpoint number
    uint8_t *errorCode     - Error code indicating the status of the transfer.
                            Only valid if the transfer is complete.

  Summary:
    This function handles Vbus events that are detected by the application.

  Description:
    This function handles Vbus events that are detected by the application.
    Since Vbus management is application dependent, the application is
    responsible for monitoring Vbus and detecting overcurrent conditions
    and removal of the overcurrent condition.  If the application detects
    an overcurrent condition, it should call this function with the event
    EVENT_VBUS_OVERCURRENT with the address of the hub and port number that
    has the condition.  When a port returns to normal operation, the
    application should call this function with the event
    EVENT_VBUS_POWER_AVAILABLE so the stack knows that it can allow devices
    to attach to that port.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    USB_EVENT vbusEvent     - Vbus event that occured.  Valid events:
                                    * EVENT_VBUS_OVERCURRENT
                                    * EVENT_VBUS_POWER_AVAILABLE
    uint8_t hubAddress         - Address of the hub device (USB_ROOT_HUB for the
                                root hub)
    uint8_t portNumber         - Number of the physical port on the hub (0 - based)

  Summary:
    This function initiates a write to the attached device.

  Description:
    This function initiates a write to the attached device.  The data buffer
    pointed to by *data must remain valid during the entire time that the
    write is taking place; the data is not buffered by the stack.

    If the endpoint is isochronous, special conditions apply.  The pData and
    size parameters have slightly different meanings, since multiple buffers
    are required.  Once started, an isochronous transfer will continue with
    no upper layer intervention until USBHostTerminateTransfer() is called.
    The ISOCHRONOUS_DATA_BUFFERS structure should not be manipulated until
    the transfer is terminated.

    To clarify parameter usage and to simplify casting, use the macro
    USBHostWriteIsochronous() when writing to an isochronous endpoint.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    uint8_t deviceAddress  - Device address
    uint8_t endpoint       - Endpoint number
    uint8_t *data          - Pointer to where the data is stored. If the endpoint
                            is isochronous, this points to an
                            ISOCHRONOUS_DATA_BUFFERS structure, with multiple
                            data buffer pointers.
    uint32_t size          - Number of data bytes to send. If the endpoint is
                            isochronous, this is the number of data buffer
                            pointers pointed to by pData.

  Return Values:
    USB_SUCCESS                     - Write started successfully.
    USB_UNKNOWN_DEVICE              - Device with the specified address not found.
    USB_INVALID_STATE               - We are not in a normal running state.
    USB_ENDPOINT_ILLEGAL_TYPE       - Must use USBHostControlWrite to write
                                        to a control endpoint.
    USB_ENDPOINT_ILLEGAL_DIRECTION  - Must write to an OUT endpoint.
    USB_ENDPOINT_STALLED            - Endpoint is stalled.  Must be cleared
                                        by the application.
    USB_ENDPOINT_ERROR              - Endpoint has too many errors.  Must be
                                        cleared by the application.
    USB_ENDPOINT_BUSY               - A Write is already in progress.
