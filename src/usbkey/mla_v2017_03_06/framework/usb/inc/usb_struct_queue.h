/* StructQueueInit
 *************************************************************************
 * Precondition:    None
 *
 * Input:           q   Pointer to the queue data structure
 *
 *                  N   Number of elements in the queue data buffer array
 *
 * Output:          None
 *
 * Returns:         zero (0)
 *
 * Side Effects:    The queue structure has been initialized and is ready 
 *                  to use.
 *
 * Overview:        This operation initializes a queue and makes it empty.
 *
 * Note:            This operation is implemented with a macro that 
 *                  supports queues of any type of data items.
 *************************************************************************/

                                (q)->count =  0   )


/* StructQueueAdd
 *************************************************************************
 * Precondition:    The queue must have been initialized and must not 
 *                  currently be full.
 *
 * Input:           q   Pointer to the queue data structure
 *
 *                  N   Number of elements in the queue data buffer array
 *
 * Output:          None
 *
 * Returns:         The address of the new item in the queue.
 *
 * Side Effects:    The item has been added to the queue.
 *
 *                  IMPORTANT!  No data has been copied to the item.
 *
 * Overview:        This operation adds (enqueues) a new item into the 
 *                  queue data buffer and updates the head index,
 *                  handling buffer wrap correctly.
 *
 * Notes:           The caller must first ensure that the queue is not 
 *                  full by performing one of the other operations (such 
 *                  as "StructQueueIsNotFull") before performing this 
 *                  operation.  Adding an item into a full queue will 
 *                  cause an access violation.
 *
 *                  This operation is implemented with a macro that 
 *                  supports queues of any type of data items.

/* StructQueueRemove
 *************************************************************************
 * Precondition:    The queue must have been initialized and not currently
 *                  be empty.
 *
 * Input:           q   Pointer to the queue data structure
 *
 *                  N   Number of elements in the queue data buffer array
 *
 * Output:          None
 *
 * Returns:         The item removed.
 *
 * Side Effects:    The item has been removed from the queue.
 *
 *                  IMPORTANT!  No data has been copied from the item.
 *
 * Overview:        This routine removes (dequeues) an item from the 
 *                  queue data buffer and updates the tail index,
 *                  handling buffer wrap correctly.
 *
 * Notes:           The caller must first ensure that the queue is not
 *                  empty by calling one or more of the other operations
 *                  (such as "StructQueueIsNotEmpty") before performing this
 *                  operation.  Dequeueing an item from an empty queue
 *                  will cause an access violation.
 *
 *                  This operation is implemented with a macro that 
 *                  supports queues of any type of data items.
