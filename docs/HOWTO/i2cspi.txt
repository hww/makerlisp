The MakerLisp Machine hardware and software have general purpose support for I2C and SPI slave
devices (master SPI devices are also supported by the hardware, but no software support for
masters other than the CPU, is available at this time).    

The eZ80 contains an SPI controller, supporting one SPI bus, and an I2C controller, supporting
one I2C bus. The SPI controller is used for the SD card device on the CPU card, and the bus can
be shared for access to other SPI slave devices. The eZ80 I2C bus controller is not connected to
any externally accessible pins, on the CPU card or the I/O expansion card, and is not used in the
MakerLisp Machine at all.

However, GPIO pins can be used to create an I2C bus on any two GPIO pins that are not being used
for something else. See ../gpio.txt for a description of the allocation and use of GPIO pins.

So on the MakerLisp Machine, with the current software support, SPI slave devices are accessed via
a shared SPI bus, using the eZ80's SPI controller, and I2C slave devices are accessed through
software manipulation ("bit-banging") of GPIO pins. It is also possible to do SPI accesses using
GPIO and software control, but no example software for this style of access is provided in the
current distribution.

Two programs in /demo demonstrate the operation of I2C and SPI devices:

1) clock7.l, a seven-segment time-of-day clock program, using an SPI device from Embedded Lab:

2) looptemp.l, a program that reads temperature sensors, using I2C devices from Closed Cube:

https://www.tindie.com/products/closedcube/hdc1080-high-accuracy-humiditytemperature-sensor/?pt=ac_prod_search

and also from MakerLisp, three (soon to be released) 'TemperSure' temperature sensor boards,
utilizing the TI TMP125 (SPI), TMP101 (I2C), and HDC1080 (I2C) temperature sensor chips.

The SPI support centers on creating an SPI device 'object' that is specialized by the SPI transfer
'mode' (polarity and phase of data read and write strobes, see the eZ80 SPI controller
documentation), speed, and the GPIO used to select the SPI device, allowing it to read and write
data on the SPI bus. See the demonstation programs, and 'spidev.l', in the demo directory, for
more information. The spidev object, and the clock7 program, rely on the 'spimode' and 'spixchg'
built-in MakerLisp primitive functions.

I2C support is done through I2C 'bus objects', on specified GPIO pins. One or more I2C devices can
exist on these buses, as long as all the devices have different addresses. See 'i2cbus.l', and
the looptemp demonstration program.

These demonstration programs can be used as templates for other experimental set-ups - for SPI
devices, take care to adjust for the GPIO used for selection (/CS), and for the desired mode and
speed of transfer. In the case of GPIO, adjust for the GPIO pins used for the bus, and the I2C
addresses of the devices used.
