Configuration and use of GPIO on CPU card / IO Expansion Board

There are 32 GPIO/IO pins on the eZ80F91, ports A, B, C, and D. In the CPU card/expansion board
configuration, these signals are connected to the mating high-density Hirose connectors on
the two boards. Other signals also are on these connectors, but this document is just concerned
with the 32 GPIO/IO pins, how they are connected on the CPU and IO boards.

All GPIO pins also have a programmable alternate connection to peripherals inside the eZ80. Some
pins will be used for these alternate functions on the CPU card, and this affects how they are
connected on the CPU card and the Hirose connectors.

1. This pin will be programmed as a GPIO output, and used to reset and restart peripherals and
controllers external to the eZ80. Low (0V, GND) will mean reset or inactive. High (TTL logic 1)
will release external devices from their reset condition, and allow them to be active. On the
CPU card, the micro-SD card circuitry is a client of this system reset, card power will be
gated off with system reset low, and restored with system reset high. Other devices on the
expansion board may also take this signal as an input.

On power up, this pin is a GPIO input. It is weakly pulled low on the CPU card, so that if no
expansion board is present this input will read 0. If an expansion board is plugged in, this pin is
pulled high through a stronger pull-up, and will read 1. So at start-up time, the eZ80 software can
determine the presence of an expansion board, for future reference. Then it will switch the pin to
be a GPIO output, drive it low for a time, and then high, effecting a system reset, and on the CPU
card, cycling power/powering on the SD card.

2. PD1 (RXD0) and PD0 (TXD0) are also optionally connected to TX and RX coming from the USB/UART
chip. When the CPU card is not plugged into the expansion board, the USB/UART is connected. When
the CPU card is plugged into the expansion board, under control of jumpers on the expansion board,
the USB/UART RX and TX may be isolated from PD1 and PD0. PD1 (RXD0) is EITHER connected to the
USB/UART, or connected to the pin on the Hirose connector, but not both. PD0 (TXD0) may be
connected to BOTH USB/UART and the pin on the Hirose connector, or only to the Hirose connector.
UART0 output can go both places, but its input is either/or.

3. The VGA terminal display holds this signal low until it is ready to start receiving characters
from the eZ80, at which time it raises this signal. The eZ80 software waits for this DTR signal
to be high, on start-up, before continuing - but it is not checked by the eZ80 software after
that. This pin is not used for flow control, only to check that the VGA display is ready to begin.
Software flow control (X-on/X-off) is used by the VGA display and the eZ80 software to keep the
eZ80 from overrunning the VGA display.

The eZ80 software will not check for VGA ready if the CPU card is not plugged into an expansion
board. If the CPU card is plugged into an expansion board but no VGA controller or other source
of a DTR signal is available, pin PB2 (/SS), which is pulled up, can be jumpered to PB1, to hold
this signal high, and to allow the eZ80 software to start-up without waiting. If no high signal
is present on PB1, the eZ80 software will time out, and continue start-up normally, after about
2 seconds.
