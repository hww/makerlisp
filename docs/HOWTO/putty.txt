How to set up the PuTTY terminal emulator for use with the MakerLisp Machine

1. Before starting PuTTY, connect the MakerLisp Machine CPU card via the USB micro connector,
to a USB port on your computer, and find the serial device (e.g. something like "COM19" on
Windows, or "/dev/ttyACM0", on Linux or Mac) that refers to the MakerLisp Machine CPU card's
USB/UART device.

2. Start PuTTY. The session configuration page will be displayed.

3. Enter a session name (e.g. "MakerLisp") in "Saved Sessions".

4. Change "Connection type" to "Serial".

5. Change "Serial line" to your serial device name, determined in step 1.

6. Change "Speed" to "115200"

7. In the "Category" pane to the left of the configuration page, choose "Terminal".

8. Set "Implicit CR in every LF".

9. Choose the "Keyboard" category under "Terminal"

10. Change the backspace key to send "Control-H".

11. Change the function key sequences to "SCO".

12. Choose the "Translation" category under "Window".

13. Change the remote character set to "CP437" from the pull-down menu.

14. If you want to change the cursor style, choose "Appearance" under "Window", and set or
reset options under "Cursor appearance". For example "Underline", and "Cursor blinks".

15. If you want to change the cursor color, choose "Colours" under "window", and and change "Cursor
Colour", for example, "187" for RGB Red, Green, and Blue values, yielding a normal intensity white
cursor color.

16. After you have finished setting these options, return to the "Session" category and push the
"Save" button. Load this session the next time you start PuTTY.

17. Open the PuTTY session and start typing, or reset the CPU card to start from scratch with
the terminal emulator connected.
