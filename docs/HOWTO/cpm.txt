How to run CP/M on the MakerLisp Machine

The Makerlisp software distribution now includes a port of CP/M 2.2. This port of CP/M, in
"src/cpm", provides the entire CP/M OS (BDOS, BIOS, and CCP) as an eZ80 flash image. CP/M disk
images, which are contained in files on a FAT32 filesystem SD card, are used to access CP/M program
and data files.

This port exists because of the generous and expert efforts of Christopher David Farrar, an
embedded software engineer and CP/M enthusiast, who responded to an inquiry on a vintage computing
Facebook group. I am extremely grateful for his contributions to, and enthusiastic support of, the
MakerLisp Machine project. The port that is provided here is practically useful, but may also be
thought of as a demonstration, or proof of concept. Chris has other configuration options and
features available for this CP/M port, and will continue to develop and maintain it going forward.
For more information, contact him at cfarrar@roadrunner.com.

To run CP/M, you need two things:

1) The CP/M port firmware, loaded to the eZ80 flash rom.

2) At least one CP/M disk image on an SD card, representing drive "A:". This image can be empty.

The CP/M OS firmware can be loaded to the eZ80 flash rom with the same utility that is used to
update the MakerLisp system software, "romupd.l" (see "doc/HOWTO/update.txt" for reference). The
MakerLisp filesystem image that you have loaded to your SD card, when you are running MakerLisp,
now contains the CP/M flash rom image that you need, in "/etc/cpm.rom". Load it to flash, like so:

(romupd '/etc/cpm.rom)

This will take about three minutes. When it is complete, you are still in MakerLisp. MakerLisp
runs in ram memory, and only copies the flash rom to ram at power-up or reset. To start CP/M,
power cycle or reset the MakerLisp Machine CPU. If you have an SD card inserted that contains at
least one CP/M disk image of the right name, in the right location (this can be the same SD card
used for the MakerLisp system), CP/M will boot, print the sign-on message, select the "A:" drive,
and present a prompt:

MakerLisp 62k CP/M Version 2.2

A>

If no suitable disk image file is found, CP/M will report an error, and wait for you to strike a
key, after which it will retry, until it successfully finds a disk image for the "A:" drive.

The CP/M hard disk image files supported by this port, emulate 8 MB hard disks, and are of the
"wbw_hd0" geometry, as described in the "diskdefs" file, in src/uSDImage/cpm/diskimg. These hard
disk images are created and accessed with "Cpmtools 2.0", available from

http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools

and also available in installation packages for several Linux distributions. The "diskdefs" file,
in Linux installations, gets copied to "/etc/cpmtools", to enable the geometries it describes, for
use with cpmtools. See the cpmtools documentation for detailed installation instructions for
your computer's operating system.

The MakerLisp CP/M port, as delivered in "/etc/cpm.rom", supports up to four CP/M disk images:

"A:" in "cpmdiska.img"
"B:" in "cpmdiskb.img"
"C:" in "cpmdiskc.img"
"D:" in "cpmdiskd.img"

The "cpmdisk?.img" files may be either in the root directory of the SD card, or in "/etc". The
MakerLisp filesystem image has a demonstration "cpmdiska.img" file in "/etc", so you can start
using CP/M immediately, with a standard MakerLisp filesystem, by simply flashing the CP/M firmware
in "cpm.rom" with "romupd.l", as described above. This CP/M disk image is also in
"src/uSDImage/cpm/diskimg/images.zip", in the file "cpmdemo.img". The "src/uSDImage/cpm" directory
also has corresponding binary files, source and documentation for the contents of the demo disk
image.

CP/M executables "romimg.com", "romcmp.com", and "romupd.com" flash rom utilities, written in
Aztec C, are provided on the demo disk image, along with the source and tools required to build
them, and they work just like their MakerLisp counterparts. A "lisp.rom" flash rom image is there
too, so you can flip back to MakerLisp, from CP/M, like so:

romupd lisp.rom

and then reset.

A note on CP/M program portability, and the MakerLisp Machine - CP/M programs ran on machines that
had widely varying functionality in keyboards and displays. Most CP/M programs expected keyboards
and displays that acted like ASCII or ANSI terminals, but these programs could be configured to
use different screen layouts and terminal command escape sequences, depending on the particulars
of the target system. "Wordstar" is a good example. We have tried a couple of Wordstar
executables downloaded from retro-computing archive sites, and they *work*, with the following
caveats:

1) The MakerLisp Machine's VGA dispay controller's default screen layout has 30 rows, but most
Wordstar installations have been configured for a 24 or 25 line display.

2) The VGA display controller's ANSI terminal emulation is not complete, and Wordstar will
sometimes use ANSI escape sequences that are not supported yet by the VGA display.

3) However, the PuTTY terminal emulator is set up for a 25 line display, and supports a full
complement of ANSI terminal commands. Wordstar seems to work perfectly on the MakerLisp Machine
CPU when it's hooked up to PuTTY via the USB/UART connection.

We will be improving the VGA display controller terminal emulation, going forward, of course.
